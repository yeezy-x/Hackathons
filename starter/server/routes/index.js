// Route registration. The router is deliberately tiny: createRouter() from
// ../router.js, first match wins, so register specific paths before parameterised
// ones ('/members/me' before '/members/:userId').
//
// YOURS TO WRITE. The file list is empty on purpose — every endpoint in BRIEF.md §5.1
// is yours to add, and the response shapes the console reads are in §5.2.
//
// Suggested split, mirroring the API: auth, orgs (orgs + members + effective + audit),
// invites, devices (devices + grants), sessions. Keep the registration order here.
//
// The server boots with this file empty: every /v1/* request returns 404 until you
// register something. That is the intended starting line.
